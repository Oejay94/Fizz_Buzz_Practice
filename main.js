/*
Fizz Buzz is a traditional coding interview challenge done on a white board. In the past, companies would have potential employees
write out the solution by hand. Since we can not do that here, you will be typing the solution on VSCode.
 
Your goal is to loop through 20 numbers and return the following
   * If the number is divisible by 3 (3, 6, 9) then console log the word Fizz
   * If the number is divisible by 5 (5, 10, 15) then console log the word Buzz
   * If the number is divisible by both 3 AND 5 then console log the word FizzBuzz
   * If the number is NOT divisible by 3 and/or 5 then console log the number itself
 
Stretch Goals!!!!!
   * Instead of using console log display the words/numbers on the body of the page in an unordered list
   * Allow users to choose how many numbers to loop through and display the results on the page
   * Maybe add a reset button
   * Figure out a way to get the desired results WITHOUT using 'if statements'. (Yes there is a way, try to research it)
